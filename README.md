# bank-check-management-system
The system is designed to centralize all of a company's account numbers, bank check numbers, and checkbook leaf numbers in one location. 
Once this information is inputted into the system, the finance department gains access to a portal where they can issue checks to vendors or suppliers. The manager portal provides an approval process for the checks. The system streamlines the process of issuing checks, while also ensuring accuracy in account and check information.
